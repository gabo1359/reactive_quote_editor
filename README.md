## Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

You can set up and run this application using Docker and Docker Compose or by installing the necessary dependencies on your local machine. Choose the setup that best suits your environment.

### Option 1: Using Docker <a name="option-1"></a>

This method requires Docker and Docker Compose to be installed on your system.

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/gabo1359/reactive_quote_editor
cd reactive_quote_editor
```

2. Build and run the application with Docker Compose:
 
```sh
docker compose up --build
```

This command builds the Docker image if it's not already built and starts the containers defined in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

3. Initial setup

Before you can use the application, you'll need to set up and prepare the database. This can be done by accessing the bash shell of your web application container:

```sh
docker compose exec web bash
```

Once inside the container, run:

```sh
bin/setup
```

This command is a way to set up or update your development environment automatically, checking for dependencies and preparing the database.

Your app should now be fully set up and accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.
